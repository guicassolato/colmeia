Java pocket project to support the teaching of Concurrent Programming to my Computer Science students.

The application simulates the life of bees in a hive, where each bee is controlled by a thread.

The ``Mutex``, used mainly to implement mutual exclusion in the access to the food supply (``Deposito``), is based on Lamport's bakery algorithm.

``Rainha`` is the queen bee; while ``Zangao`` stands for bumblebee and ``Operaria`` for worker bee.
